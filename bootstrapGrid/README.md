# Bootstrap Grid Practice

Please recreate the desired image. You'll need to create all the relevant markup (container, row, column, etc.). I'm not testing your code for the specific colors, but I recommend giving the columns background colors so that you can differentiate them. I'm also not testing for the specific text in each column.

- **Desired image is in the images folder**.
