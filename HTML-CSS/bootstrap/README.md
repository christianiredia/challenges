# Bootstrap Basics Practice

There is starter markup in _index.html_. Bootstrap is already included! Please add in the appropriate bootstrap classes according to these instructions:

Make the section a _bootstrap container_

Give the h1 _white text_, a _dark background_, and _center-aligned text_

Make the div an _alert_ ('warning' color). Set the role attribute to _alert_, for accessibility purposes!

Make the first button a _green bootstrap button_

Make the second button a _red bootstrap button_

The **Desired Image** is in the _images_ folder.
