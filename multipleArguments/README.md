# Multiple Arguments

In some dice games like Craps, a roll of two 1's is called "Snake Eyes". It's generally not a good roll.  
Please write a function called _isSnakeEyes_, which accepts two numbers as inputs, representing two dice.  
If the two numbers are both 1's, please print **"Snake Eyes!"** otherwise print **"Not Snake Eyes!"**

_Example:_

- isSnakeEyes(1,1) //Snake Eyes!
- isSnakeEyes(1,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
- isSnakeEyes(4,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
