# Form Events Exercise

Time to get some practice working with forms and form events! _index.html_ already has a form element that contains two _< input >_ elements, one for quantity and one for a product name. _index.html_ also contains an empty < ul > where you will append new < li >'s. Watch the [gif](./desiredImage/image.gif) to see the Desired Result.
Your task is to follow these steps:

- When the form is submitted, prevent the default behavior

- Grab the quantity input value and the product input value

- Create a new < li > element. Set the text on the new < li > to include the quantity and product name from the form.

- Append the new < li > to the < ul > on the page

- Reset the inputs
