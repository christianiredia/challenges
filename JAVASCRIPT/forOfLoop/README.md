# For...Of Practice

Let's practice using for...of. I've provided you with an array called numbers. Please use a for...of loop to loop over it, and print out the **square of** each value (the number multiplied by itself).

Your output should look like this:

- 1
- 4
- 9
- 16
- 25
- 36
- 49
- 64
- 81
