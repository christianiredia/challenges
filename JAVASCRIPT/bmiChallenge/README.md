# Coding Challenge

Mark and John are trying to compare their **BMI** (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
_BMI = mass / height \** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter)_.

**Your tasks:**

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
   versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
   whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

**Test data:**

- Data 1: Marks _weights 78 kg_ and is _1.69 m tall_. John _weights 92 kg_ and is _1.95m tall_.

- Data 2: Marks _weights 95 kg_ and is _1.88 m tall_. John _weights 85 kg_ and is _1.76m tall._
