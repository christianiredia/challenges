# Coding Challenge

Create a function that takes 2 card objects as parameters,
`card1` and `card2`. These card objects have a property called
`value`, which can be any one of the following strings, in
order of rising "score":

- "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
  "10",
- "JACK", "QUEEN", "KING", "ACE"

I.e. "2" is the lowest score and "ACE" is the highest.

The function should determine which of the 2 cards (`card1`
or `card2`) has the higher score, or if they have the same score.

Log which card wins (or "It's a tie!"
if they're the same) to the console
