# Egg Laying Exercise

Define an object called _hen_. It should have three properties:

- _name_ should be set to 'Helen'

- _eggCount_ should be set to 0

- _layAnEgg_ should be a method which increments the value of eggCount by 1 and returns the string "EGG". You'll need to use _this._

1. hen.name // "Helen"
2. hen.eggCount // 0
3. hen.layAnEgg() // "EGG"
4. hen.layAnEgg() // "EGG"
5. hen.eggCount // 2
