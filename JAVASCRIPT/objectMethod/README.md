#Object Methods

1. Add a method called _'describe'_ to a 'myCountry' object. This method
   will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
   assignment, but this time using the **'this'** keyword.

2. Call the _'describe'_ method

3. Add a method called _'checkIsland'_ to the 'myCountry' object. This
   method will set a new property on the object, called _'isIsland'_.
   'isIsland' will be _true_ if there are no neighbouring countries, and _false if
   there are_.
   _Use the ternary operator to set the property._
