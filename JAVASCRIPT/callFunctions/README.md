# Functions Calling Other Functions

1. Create a function called _'describePopulation'_. Use the function type you
   like the most. This function takes in two arguments: _'country'_ and
   _'population'_, and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
   which is about 18.2% of the world.'

2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
   'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier

3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice
