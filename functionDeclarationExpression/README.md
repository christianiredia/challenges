# Function Declarations vs. Expressions

1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function **declaration**
   called _'percentageOfWorld1'_ which receives a _'population' value_, and
   returns the _percentage of the world population that the given population_
   represents.

_For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
the world population_

2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given _'population' value_ by 7900
   and then multiply by 100

3. Call _'percentageOfWorld1'_ for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
   store the results into variables, and log them to the console

4. Create a function **expression** which does the exact same thing, called
   _'percentageOfWorld2'_, and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
   the same populations)
